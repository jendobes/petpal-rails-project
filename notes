REQUIREMENT
1) DONE: index pets in shelter show page
  *PROBLEM: need to figure out how to include the image url with JSON data
2) DONE: sift through the animals in a specific shelter with the next button
  *PROBLEM: this works, but the attriubtes are very nested. I feel like the serializer is messed up.
3) DONE: pets have many rescue stories. render this with serializer.
  *PROBLEM: cannot get attributes of rescues through json. pet serializer messed up.
4) DONE: create a rescue story, append that rescue story to pet show page
5) DONE: have model pet object in shelter rendering


TODO:

Get pet image onto shelter pet card
serializer not rendering correctly? attributes are very nested
persist the rescue story to the pet page --> this is the has_many relationship revealed through the Serializer
cannot get attributes for a rescue through pets
